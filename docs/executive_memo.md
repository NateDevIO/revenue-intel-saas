# Executive Memo: Revenue Intelligence Platform

## Situation

Modern B2B SaaS companies face a complex revenue lifecycle with multiple leakage points:

1. **Funnel Inefficiency**: Without stage-by-stage analytics, sales teams can't identify where deals are falling out of the pipeline or why.

2. **Reactive Churn Management**: Most companies only address churn after customers have already decided to leave—too late for effective intervention.

3. **Blind Spots in Unit Economics**: LTV:CAC ratios and payback periods often aren't tracked at the segment level, leading to misallocated resources.

4. **Decision Paralysis**: Leadership lacks the ability to model "what-if" scenarios with quantified confidence, leading to delayed or suboptimal strategic decisions.

## Findings

### Revenue Analysis Summary

Based on the synthetic data analysis (representative of typical B2B SaaS patterns):

| Metric | Value | Benchmark | Assessment |
|--------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Net Revenue Retention | ~103% | 105% (median) | Below target |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | ~3.2x | 3.0x (median) | On target |
| Monthly Churn Rate | ~2.5% | 2.0% (median) | Needs improvement |
| ARR at Risk | ~$X.XM | - | Actionable |

### Key Insights

1. **Funnel Analysis**
   - SMB segment has higher lead volume but lower conversion rates at later stages
   - Enterprise deals convert at higher rates but require 1.8x longer sales cycles
   - Loss reasons at negotiation stage are dominated by price (35%) and competitors (30%)

2. **Churn Patterns**
   - Usage decline 60 days before churn is the strongest predictor
   - NPS detractors churn at 3x the rate of promoters
   - First 90 days have the highest churn risk (onboarding critical period)

3. **Revenue Leakage Sources**
   - Lost deals: $X.XM annually
   - Customer churn: $X.XM annually
   - Missed expansion: $X.XM annually
   - Downgrades: $X.XM annually
